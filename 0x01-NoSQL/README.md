                                                              NoSQL
1. What Does NoSQL Mean?

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and refers to a broad class of databases that don't follow the traditional table-based relational database model (SQL). NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and can support a variety of data models.

2. Difference Between SQL and NoSQL
Feature	SQL (Relational Databases)	NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)
Data Structure	Uses tables with rows and columns	Uses flexible data structures such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs
Schema	Has a fixed schema; data must fit predefined structure	Schema-less or dynamic schema
Scalability	Vertical scaling (adding more power to one server)	Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)
ACID Compliance	Fully ACID-compliant	Not always ACID-compliant (but some NoSQL databases can be)
Query Language	SQL (Structured Query Language)	No standard query language, often proprietary

3. What is ACID?

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability, and it defines key properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably:

    Atomicity: All operations in a transaction are completed, or none are.
    Consistency: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
    Isolation: Transactions are processed independently, without interference.
    Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently stored.

While SQL databases always follow ACID principles, NoSQL databases may relax some of these properties to gain better performance or scalability.

4. What is Document Storage?
Document storage is a type of NoSQL database that stores, retrieves, and manages data in a document format, typically using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), BSON (Binary JSON), or XML. Each document can store a variety of data structures, including nested structures and arrays, making it highly flexible.

    Example of a document in MongoDB (a NoSQL database):

    json

    {
        "_id": "12345",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com",
        "age": 29
    }

5. NoSQL Types

There are four primary types of NoSQL databases:

    Document-based (e.g., MongoDB) – stores documents.
    Key-value stores (e.g., Redis) – pairs keys and values.
    Column-family stores (e.g., Cassandra) – stores data in columns rather than rows.
    Graph-based (e.g., Neo4j) – stores data as nodes and relationships, ideal for highly interconnected data.

6. Benefits of a NoSQL Database

    Flexibility: Schema-less design allows easy changes to data structures.
    Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally across many servers.
    High Performance: Optimized for high-speed read and write operations.
    Handles Large Data: Best suited for big data applications.

7. How to Query Information from a NoSQL Database (MongoDB Example)

MongoDB uses a flexible query language, with JSON-like syntax. To retrieve data from a MongoDB database:

    Find all documents in a collection:

    javascript

db.users.find()

Find documents with a specific field value:

javascript

    db.users.find({ "age": 29 })

8. How to Insert/Update/Delete Information from a NoSQL Database (MongoDB Example)

    Insert a document into a collection:

    javascript

db.users.insertOne({
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "age": 29
})

Update a document:

javascript

db.users.updateOne(
    { "name": "John Doe" },
    { $set: { "email": "john.doe@newmail.com" } }
)

Delete a document:

javascript

    db.users.deleteOne({ "name": "John Doe" })

9. Beginner-Friendly Tutorial: Using MongoDB

Step 1: Install MongoDB MongoDB can be installed locally or used as a cloud service via MongoDB Atlas.

    To install MongoDB locally, follow the installation guide for your OS.
    
    

Step 2: Start the MongoDB Service Once installed, you can start MongoDB by running the following command:

mongod

Step 3: Connect to MongoDB To connect to the MongoDB instance, open another terminal and type:

mongo

Step 4: Create a Database MongoDB allows you to create a new database by simply switching to it:

javascript

use mydatabase

Step 5: Create a Collection Collections in MongoDB are like tables in SQL. You can create a new collection like this:

javascript

db.createCollection("users")

Step 6: Insert Documents You can insert documents into the collection:

javascript

db.users.insertOne({
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "age": 30
})

Step 7: Query Data Retrieve all documents in the collection:

javascript

db.users.find()

Step 8: Update Data Update Alice's email address:

javascript

db.users.updateOne(
    { "name": "Alice" },
    { $set: { "email": "alice@newmail.com" } }
)

Step 9: Delete Data Delete Alice's record:

javascript

db.users.deleteOne({ "name": "Alice" })

With these basics, you can begin exploring more complex operations and features MongoDB offers, such as indexing, aggregation, and sharding for larger datasets.

This tutorial provides an overview of NoSQL databases, explains core concepts, and walks through basic MongoDB operations. It’s ideal for beginners who want to understand the key differences from SQL databases and how to work with a NoSQL system like MongoDB.
